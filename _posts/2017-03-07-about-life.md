This should be my last post on this website before I adjust the theme and content. I will migrate the site to jekyll since I found hexo has a problem of separating generating site and generated site. Besides, I will put this front page to my personal bio similar to two famout Githubers - Karpathy and Yen. I found the style awesome and no one else has made a similar page. So I will try to make a template of it and open-source it later.

## Back to the start of life

I was recently being reading *Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind* written by Yuval Noah Harari. I have listened to the audio version of this book during running twice or more. The idea of finding the root of humankind and myself is simply fanscinating. I learned my father's life story after coming back from Finland and that is like only happened in soap shows. I will write something about it later if I have time. But the human kind, including diversity we share, is one species, one earth-dominant species. I always wonder how my ancestors live since they don't have computer, light, electricity, bed, clothes, ...... They must live like animals! When I am cold with clothes on, I thought how could ancestors survive during such weather, aren't they cold? Then, since I am in Asia, there are much more people than back in Europe, I observe people all the time and find the behavior like hugging, kissing, shaking hands, padding, etc, these behaviors are so humanic. Even though some animals has similar behavior, when it happens between two homo sapiens, there won't raise a feeling in me rejecting these behavior. I do not think these behavior are awkward at all. But the thinking like these could be awkward for non carbon-based species. Why are sapiens doing these? 

More specifically for me, since I am a little man, I always wonder why am I attract to so-called 'beautiful' girls? Why can't I resist 'beautiful' girls? This troubles me A LOT. Maybe because I am not popular even at Asian market, yet all other homo sapiens will try to find a parter, which seems so natural for them. But why? Why even in the most strict period of time and in the strict order of law, homo sapiens cannot resist to find a parter? Is it the hormones or is it something else? I wonder. After all, I am a computer science undergraduate, when I look from a computer's perspective I found so-called 'love' is mystery, there can hardly be a quantitive evaluation of 'love'. But what sapiens try to do is reproduct and it is like a while loop inside.

## Write a GA code then
Yeah, I am wondering about it but I am not confident yet.

## Find a girlfriend then
Nah, not really, I am not social dude, I haven't meet a lot of girls yet. Maybe when I have more choices I can do it. But still, it IS awkward. 

## Final

Okay, I will update the website soon. Stay in tuned.
