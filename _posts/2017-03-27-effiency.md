## Note down what you have done

Every evening before I went to sleep I would note down what I have done this day. There are days I felt I didn't do anything because I cannot write anything down. On the morning, before I open my eyes I would think about what I should do today using 'tomato' method (priority & importance)

## Make a timetable or TODO list

This is useful as well. But I am a lazy dude so most times I cannot finish what I planned. :/ 

## Dream

This is cliche. But it is important for anyone. Knowing what you would achieve in the future definitely motivate one to do much more. Pretend being real until real.
