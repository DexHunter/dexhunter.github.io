title: "The math I encountered"
---

Just quickly document the math I met in portfolio management problem for later review:
* covariance matrix `numpy.cov`
* Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients
* hessian matrix
* convex optimization 
* non-linear programming
* sqp (sequential quadratic programming) `scipy.optimize.minimize`
* online newton method (`cvxopt.solvers`) quadratic programming
* mean reversion
* median reversion


portfolio management is, afterall, a optimization problem. So tackle it from a mathematical perspective is a good start.
