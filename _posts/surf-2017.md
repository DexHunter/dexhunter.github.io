# Topic of our SURF

I have been struggling about surf research for a while now. Initially deep reinforcement learning was the background theme I chose since I have been reading Zhengyao's codes for a while. Then our PhD supervisor directs us to classification problem with PSO. To be honest, I do not want to do classification anymore since they are quite simple in mathematics and easy to implement with software like weka or lib like spark. But on the other side it could be a good start for other team members and me to work together on a academic paper. So the major problem would be using pso to classify high-dimensional and multiclass datasets. The following is my draft of proposal should be updated soon. 

# Abstract

PSO(particle swarm optimization)

# Out of topic

A lot of students in our university are just so noob!! They are like keyboard men on the Internet having nothing to do. I feel sympathy for those who spend most of their time on the phone browsing.

Another interesting fact is that with enough people coming in to the uni, there will always be 1-2 true genius hidden in the crowd. I think this is called probability.
