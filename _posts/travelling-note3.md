# Insanity of Chinese

Even though I understand most Chinese nowadays only believe in money, it is still shocking to see how much they will do for it. Without basic trust between humans, it is hard to do anything. Maybe this is one of reasons I am not "Chinese" and won't live in China. I don't like to take photos with my Chinese parents in public so they think I'm "irrational" and criticize me often.  My dislike of taking photos of homo sapiens origins from my experience in Finland but I would love to take photos of landscape or the beauty of nature. But my Chinese parents never understood that. My Chinese father often said "You are a moron", which hurt me a lot. But I took a pity and felt sympathy of my Chinese father because he lost lots of money gambling and buying fake. This trip is arranged by one of his "friends" and during the trip he bought so-called local tea and jade of around 10,000 RMB. But when I searched on taobao (a Chiense e-commerce website) the price is around 100 RMB. So obviously he was deceived by his so-called "friend" and local tour guide. After I told him the truth, he refused to believe it and said the CCTV report (tour guide will get 85% commission for everything tourists bought, [source in Chinese](http://money.163.com/16/0506/21/BMDPR4G700253B0H.html)) and other proofs ([source1 in Chinese](https://www.zhihu.com/question/30040780), [source2 in Chinese](https://www.zhihu.com/question/30044574)) are fake news. I felt sympathy for him because his horrible temper got him no true friends, only those who wants to take advantage of him. But sometimes I also felt angry towards him because I remembered when I asked him to pay for my essay check fee of 1 RMB (yes, only 1 rmb on taobao, [link](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a230r.1.14.31.FrAxzj&id=540584410066&ns=1&abbucket=17#detail)), he refused to pay because I can do it myself by free. Moreoever, when I want to upgrade my laptop, he forbade me buying a new one, instead forcing me to buy a used one with poor performance. Maybe that's why I am so eager about using the best device I can afford. My father is leather-lunged and always invent his own theory to "persuade" others. Since I mostly talk in normal tone and have a hard time raising my voice, I never won any arguments with him. He will keep talking and won't let me to oppose his opinion or tell my opinion. But sometimes I could get a good sense of sarcasm when listening to his arguments. I don't think I will take care of my Chinese parents when I was older because they showed no love and respect of me which deeply hurt me and I probably won't stay in China anyways.

When I went to Finland, my Finnish parents taught me how a healthy family look like and how child can interact with their parents and I greatly appreciate them for this love and kindness they showed me. That was the first time I know how a family can be.

# Dislike of Chinese culture

Even though I have stayed in China for more than 20 years and my mother tone is Chinese, I had a hard time adopting Chinese culture. I do not share Chinese values like I said above and I do not have a sense of identity as Chinese. I am highly opposed to what Chinese government did and is doing. I advocate the freedom of speech and less censorship of Internet. But Chinese communist government is really terrible on those topics. The false coverage of certain news caused by censorship and fear by government controlled news is the root of many negative culture influence of China. Unfortunately, Chinese government only wants to make it worse by applying more censorship instead of giving right back to people.

# Lack of evidence

A lot of what I wrote is based on my own experience, but to make it more convincible I will put several references later.
