## What is remote?

According to [this post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20889346/what-does-git-remote-mean), `remote` is repository. If you do something like `git remote add origin git@github.com:dex/first_app.git`, it will create a new remote called `origin` at `git@github.com:dex/first_app.git`. Once you did this, you can push to `origin` instead of the whole URL
