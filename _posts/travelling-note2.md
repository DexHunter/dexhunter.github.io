# Too Tired

Well, in China travelling is not an easy task for anytime. I didn't sleep well, didn't eat well, didn't sh*t well. So it's a pretty exhausting experience of travelling.

# Why I will Never Travel again in China

I won't travel in China again! 

The first reason is about travelling itself. I am not a travelling type. Even though I would like to come out of my comfort zone, it's rather exhausting to travel in China. When you travel in China, the most common thing you will see is other human beings. I mean A LOT! Besides, the local government did not care to clean the street or beautify the environment. 

Second reason is chaos. Today I travelled through DALI old city, it's a total mess. The street is chaotic and street vendors are everywhere. 

Third reason is that I probably won't come back to China after I go to further study in US. I do not share the same value as most Chinese and I dislike the Chinese communist government. They are simply horrible to me. Although I am an Asian, western culture suits me better, the freedom of speech and less censorship. Some people may argue about delicious Chinese food, but what I need is meat. As long as there are enough eatable meat, I am satisfied.
