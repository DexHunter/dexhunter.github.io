## Background

Being one of the maintainers of fabric-sdk-py for a while now, I have somewhat deeper understanding of the fabric framework and blockchain technology in general. However, some concepts in fabric seems to be overwhelmingly hard to understand or the official documentation seems too rebundant for beginners as one of my colleges in Beihang University reported. So I decide to write some short tutorials to demystify some frequently used features with examples in Hyperledger Fabric.

## What is Endorsement Policy?


#### Functionality of Endorsement Policy

Endorsement Policy sets the rules about the number of peers/orgs which must recach agreement on the execution of a chaincode given a set of inputs.


## What is MSP (Membership Service Provider)?

## How the two related?
