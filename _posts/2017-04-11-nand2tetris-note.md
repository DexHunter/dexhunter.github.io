# What is nand2tetris?

[Nand2tetris](http://www.nand2tetris.org/about.php) is an open-source course for students and self-learners to build a modern, full-scale computer system including hardware and software from the ground up.

I will implement the computer system I wrote on a FPGA later. Currently I am still try to finish the course.

This post will be updated when I finish.

Cheers!
