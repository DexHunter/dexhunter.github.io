# travelling conclusion

This shoud be my last ntoe during the trip. I had a cold today. I felt sick and uncomfortable. I drank some medicine but I don't know if I turns better it's whether medicine or myself ability to heal.

I would like to tell another terrible experience I had in China. It's getting driver license. My Chinese father had a "friend" who teaches driving in a vacational school. Thus, I was enrolled in that "friend"'s class. When I went to the "school" I figured out it's terrible. Every coach has around 20-30 students everyday.

My Chinese father is pitiful because all his "friends" refused to help him when he was jobless and no one would take care of him except me and my Chinese mother. But he was impudent and arrogant, instead of admitting the truth he said he would not need help from anyone even when he was jobless and had no extra money. Since my Chinese father was a low-paid and self-taught technician, he always think of himself as emotionally and intelligently excellent which echoes my deep sympathy even after countless terrible things he did to me. I don't even hate him anymore. I am a new man. I am freshed.

# What is Travelling?

So far, I have no idea what is travelling. Travelling to me is just non-sense. In Finalnd, people live in "forest" or I can say the place people live is as scenic as the place I visited in Yunan (except the high and continuous mountains)
