# Conclusion from the meeting

* PSO hyperplane/hypersphere
* translating ancient Chinese with Deep Learning/NLP
* test gcForest

Teammates are not so confident about PSO topic. I am not interested in that either. Opitimization should be done inside a bigger project.

# Possible suggestion

I am not so happy with my teammates since they do not have a clear idea of how to use pso. Even when the PhD student suggests this topic I found this too academic. I certainly have no idea where the innovation is. Besides that, I would like to make an application instead of tuning parameters. So I suggested to test gcForest (a cascade tree model) but after I talked with friend ZY. J, the method needs to be further tested. So I would to like to go back to dNN and propose something similar to what my friend ZY. J is doing.

# Update (after meeting with Prof)

(3/3/2017) We met with prof this morning. But we were only able to discuss about PSO. Prof is very busy and need to leave before 9. Anyway, the main problem we found is lack of innovation or in other words, we don't know if we can improve the algorithm. Thus, I will write a detailed propose. I have to admit I lack certain interest in developing yet another classifier. It is boring to me and I cannot see any future benefit from doing such classifier.(maybe I was too short-sighted there but we'll see as time passed by)

(6/3/2017) I sent the first letter to Prof telling him we would like to change our rsearch topic. He replied okay. So we re-directed ourselves to a new field of DL. I like the research topic. I have already opened a private repo and hope to contribute as much as possible.

More reading to do.
