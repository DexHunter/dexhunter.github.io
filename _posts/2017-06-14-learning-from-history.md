# Digital History

Recently, I was reading *the innovators* by Walter Isaacson. This is particularly interesting book to me because I was always fascinated by how computer is created or invented. We enjoy so much about Internet, laptop, namingly new technology without single clue on who invented or how those are invented. The book told the story of digital world and how the digital world come into beings. I love the idea of combining creative genius and practical engieers to form a strong team thus transforming the entire history. Once somehting has been invented or put together, people stop think it is a myth anymore. I think this is the beauty of it that challenges our mind.
