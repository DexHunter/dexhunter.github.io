## What is a normal day of yours?

Mostly research and coding. I love to know how something works and why it works. I am driven by new technology and I belittle money and fame, even though I need money to live on. But since one of my researches is on portfolio management and we did online trading at real market (cryptocurrencies, forex, etc.), I think I will be able to afford myself and my interests for now.

Besides, I also workout A LOT. I used to think I will be a bodybuilder, but after I learned to program, this becomes a far-away dream, though I do want to have six-packs. If you ever see me at gym, feel free to come and say hello :)
