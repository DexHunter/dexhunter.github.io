Hello, I am Dex. Thank you for your effort and interest in wanting to know what I really am. (I am also a big fan of finding others' background)

## What's your background?
I am an Asian dude. My grandfather was acutally born in Thainland and went back to China. My father was adopted by my grandparents and found his biological parents in his 40s.

## What do you do at weekends?
Mostly research and coding. I love to know how something works and why it works. I am driven by new technology and I belittle money and fame, even though I need money to live on. But since one of my research interest is portfolio management and we did real trading on real market, I think I will be able to afford myself and my interest.

Besides, I also workout A LOT. I used to think I will be a bodybuilder, but after I learned to program, this becomes a far-away dream, though I do want to have six-packs. If you ever see me at gym, come and say hello :)

## Some favorite things
* My favorite movie: *The Life of Brian* by *Monty Python*
* My favoirte language: Python
* My favorite laptop brand: thinkpad t series (currently)
* My favorite OS: Ubuntu (I am thinking changing to Arch though LOL)
* My favorite text editor: Vim (I only use vim & zsh, I never get used to other IDEs)
