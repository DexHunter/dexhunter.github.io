Hello, I am Dixing (Dex) Xu. Thank you for your effort and interest in wanting to know what I really am.

## Some interesting facts about myself

* I went to Finland during 2012-2013 for high school exchange.
* I had high school for 4 years (1 year exchange) and college for 5 years (1 year work).
* My grandfather was actually born in Thailand and brought back to China when he is 2 years old. 
* My father was adopted by my grandparents and found his biological parents in his 40s.
* I lived in a military-restricted area in China before (2005-2015).
* I can do a lot sports including but not limited to tennis, table tennis, swimming, golf, basketball, football (American/non-American), badminton, ~~kendo~~, archery, baseball.
* First touched computer when I was 7 on a Windows 95, but I only learned programming after getting into college.
 
## What is a normal day of yours?

Mostly research and coding. I love to know how something works and why it works. I am driven by new technology and I belittle money and fame, even though I need money to live on. But since one of my research interest is portfolio management and we did real trading on real market, I think I will be able to afford myself and my interest.

Besides, I also workout A LOT. I used to think I will be a bodybuilder, but after I learned to program, this becomes a far-away dream, though I do want to have six-packs. If you ever see me at gym, come and say hello :)
